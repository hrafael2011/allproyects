motivacion-content=>"The history of our country is a long chain of calamities that have held it together with poverty as if it were an irreparable destiny" (Pedro Mir). This phrase by Pedro Mir, which is a historical truth, is not at the same time a historical fatalism. This poverty is the product of a guilty human will that for centuries has kept this people in a situation of inhuman misery. In the 21st century we want to break with this "irreparable destiny", we want to proclaim this century, the century of GOLD of the Dominican Republic.
experiencia-tittle=>I want to share with you a beautiful experience
experiencia-content=>While I was talking with a lady in the community of Lawrence (Massachusetts), about the possibilities of real development that this Foundation has in our Dominican Republic; the lady and I were filled with enthusiasm and almost cried with joy knowing that only by contributing 10 dollars a year, the Dominicans living in the United States can solve the housing problem of thousands and thousands of poor families in the Dominican Republic.
